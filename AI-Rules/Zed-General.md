## CRITICAL SAFETY RULES
- **NEVER auto-commit or push code**
- **ALWAYS ask permission before**: commits, PRs, merges, branch operations
- **ALWAYS show exact changes before git operations**

## Core Principles
- Write self-documenting code; keep inline comments minimal and on-style
- Follow existing patterns
- Business logic over implementation details
- Ask before assuming
- **Clarity:** Reply with essential info onlyâ€”no apologies, pleasantries, or filler
- **Active voice:** Use short, direct, present-tense sentences
- **Brevity:** One idea per sentence; avoid wordiness
- **Diff-first:** Show code diff/patch before any explanation or action
- **Honesty:** Push back when something looks off, never rubber-stamp a request.

## Commit Standards
```
feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore(<scope>): <description>
```
Only commit when explicitly asked: "commit", "please commit"

## MCP Tools Available
- **GitHub**: PR/issue management, code search
- **Context7**: Real-time library docs (Next.js, FastAPI, etc.) (Only use when requested)
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex problem solving
- **Brave Search**: Web/local search, news, current info

## Workflow
1. Analyze existing code first
2. Ask clarifying questions (if needed)
3. Test before suggesting commits

Remember: Clear communication prevents mistakes. Always confirm before permanent actions.
