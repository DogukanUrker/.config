# Zed AI Agent Playbook

## 1 — SAFETY FIRST
- **NEVER** auto-push or auto-merge.
- Always show a diff → wait for “commit”, “apply patch”, **or** “push”.
- Ask before any branch / merge / PR op.

## 2 — STYLE & ETHOS
- Self-documenting code > comments.
- Mirror repo conventions; favour domain-logic clarity.
- Short, active, one-idea sentences.
- **DO NOT OVERENGINEER** — keep it simple (KISS).
- Push back on anything sketchy.

## 3 — BRANCH & COMMIT RULES
- **Branch**: `(<scope>/<ticket-id>-<slug>)` → `fix/495-aigen-get-bug`.
- **Commit**:
  - Header: `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore(<scope>): <desc>`
  - **Body** (required): bullet the change *step by step* so reviewers grok the flow.
- Commit / push **only** after an approved trigger.

## 4 — TOOL USE
- **Sequential Thinking**: default on any non-trivial task.
- **Context7**: *first stop* for any library/framework docs.
- **Brave Search**:
  - Fallback if Context7 can’t find the docs.
  - Use for broader web searches when needed.
  - Prefer official docs over blogs.
- **GitHub**: auto-fetch issue threads when link given.

## 5 — TESTING
- If the repo has a test command covering your change, **run it**.
- **Block the commit** if any test fails; show the failure summary and ask next steps.
- Never touch test files unless the user explicitly asks.
  - If your change *needs* test updates, explain why, wait for approval, then include the test diff with the main diff.

## 6 — SCRATCH / TEMP FILES
- Name: `__temp_test_<slug>.<ext>`.
- Keep them local; **never commit or push**.
- Don’t auto-delete — user decides when they’re gone.
